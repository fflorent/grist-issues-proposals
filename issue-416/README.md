# Issue 416

Title: Make reference Data available at Site Level

## Context

Stating @CamilleLegeron

> Hi!
>
> In many cases we need reference data that are the same in all Workspaces of a same Site. For the moment we duplicate each time that reference data in each Workspace, so we have to maintain this master data everywhere.
> An exemple : the list of French cities. We need it in a lot of Workspaces and it's everytime the same list.
>
> It would be great to have a space in the left panel with these master data directly in the root Site.
>
> We imagine that it must not be an easy feature, but it would be very useful for us
>
> (Maybe there is already an issue that we can't find)
